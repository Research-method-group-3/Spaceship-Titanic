# Spaceship-Titanic
In this project we will be developing an end to end machine learning pipeline Using the spaceship titanic dataset. The Spaceship titanic is a very popular dataset in the data science community. The particular dataset used in this development was gotten from kaggle. The dataset contains details of passsengers on a spaceship heading to Destinations outside our solar system.

However, just like the RMS Titanic encouter a tragedy when it collides with an iceberg on its voyage and never made to New York, the Spaceship Titanic also collided with a spacetime anomaly which results in the Transportation of some passengers to an alternate dimension.

The Spaceship titanic dataset contains the records of passengers on board and also include details on whether they were transported or not. There are two dataset in the spaceship data directory namely train and test. The train dataset contains details on whether the passenger was transported whereby the target column transported is absent in the test dataset.

Before a model can be trained to predict the traget columns of the test dataset some number of task as to be performed on the dataset to gain more insight about the data i.e finding parterns between the two classes, cleaning the data and finding the optimal way of getting the missing values in the dataset.
